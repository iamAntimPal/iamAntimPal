# ✅ Tips to Set Up Sponsorship Tiers
- **Keep the first tier cheap** ($3–$5) so anyone can support you easily.
- **Offer visible rewards** (like name mention or early access) — people like recognition!
- **Higher tiers** can give people a small influence (like suggesting ideas).
- **Consistency matters**: Keep posting new projects/tutorials to make sponsors proud.
